# REPOSITORIES
### Open Source Projects
These projects will focus on the collaboration of development. Joining an Opensource Project within Hearst Marketplace is the same as joining a public version. The difference is that we will build, share and tend the code within Hearst only. Some projects may be promoted to public open source if they show more broad value and appeal. Creating a Hearst Open Source Project is easy, so let's get started building awesome code together!

### Shared Code
If you have a killer script or application that you think others could use and benefit from, share it on the Marketplace! If the code has potential to becoming a larger application, turn it into an open source project.
